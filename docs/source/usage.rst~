Usage of download_file
======================

The ``download.download_file()`` function allows the user
to download locally on his device files from the internet.

This tool offers simple error handling like checking URL
correctness, avoids downloading files multiple times
and offers a basic progress bar to check the download
status (useful for large datasets download).
