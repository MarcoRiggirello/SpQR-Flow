plot_utils
==========

In the ``plot_utils`` module we have defined a function,
``make_gif``,
to realize animated gifs out of a list of figures.
This is to us
a fine way to visualize the imporvement during training of a
machine learning algorithm, especially if they deal with
reproducing patterns or images.
